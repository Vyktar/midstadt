<div id="class">Wonderus Item, Rare (Attunement Required)</div>
<div id="text">
This arcane tome exudes a dark and ominous aura. Any creature who has this grimoire in their possesion is granted +1 to all spell attacks, saving throws and damage related to the enchantment and necromancy schools of magic. It can also be used as a spell casting focus.<br><br>
Curse. This grimoire is cursed, causing the first person who touches it to instantly become attuned to it. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the grimoire, keeping it close to you at all times. Should the book be stolen from you or leave your person, you will be compelled by dark whispers to take back the grimoire as soon as you can. The farther away and longer it stays out of your reach, the larger your desire to retake the grimoire will grow. If you are parted from the grimoire for too long, your desire will turn into a ravenous frenzy, the whispers will escalate to screams, and you will do anything in your power to hold the grimoire in your hands once more.

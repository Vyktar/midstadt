This plain starfish holds a dark power, and when plaved on a creatures skin, it allows them to transform one of there arms into a writhing tentacle. Unarmed attacks made with this arm are changes to 1d4 by default, plus any strength modifiers for extra damage. The tentacle has a 10 ft range, and can be used in conjunction with any 1 handed weapon to effectively double the range of any 1 handed melee weapon attack. The tentacle also provide advantage when trying to grapple any opponent, doubles your grip strength allowing you to swing or hang from surfaces much easier, the suction cups from the tentacle allow you to suspend yourself from a wall or ceiling, and doubles your effectiveness. If you keep the starfish attached to your body from long enough, you will gain the ability to switch between the tentacle arm and your normal arm at will, allowing you to hide the presence of your tentacle arm from anyone you fear might disapprove of its appearance.

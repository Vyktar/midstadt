<h2 id="name">Truebronze Ring of Ice</h2>
<div id="class">Wonderus Item, Very Rare (Attunement Required)</div>
<div id="text">
This ring is imbued with the power of ice, allowing the wearer to activate it’s power on command to freeze a small area or surface within their vicinity or a creature standing next to them in a sheet of ice.<br><br>
This ring has a total of 5 charges plus an additional number of charges equal to the wearers spellcasting modifier. If the player is not a spellcaster, intelligence is used as the modifier. The ring replenishes all its charges every 24 hours. Additionally, the wearer may also use a level one spell slot to replenish 5 charges of the ring or a level 2 spell slot to recover the maximum number of charges the ring can hold.<br><br>
If the player wishes to freeze the ground, a wall or a surface of water, they must expend one charge from the ring to freeze an area equal to 5ft in diameter. The player must be standing next to the surface they wish to freeze, upon which they may choose if they wish to spread the ice out from it’s origin point by a number of 5ft increments equal to the rings remaining charges.<br><br>
Additionally, the user may also choose whether the surface is slippery or not, causing anyone who walks on this surface to fall prone if they fail an acrobatics check. The difficulty of this check is equal to the casters spell save dc, and if they user in not a spell caster, the check is determined by the wearers intelligence by default. The wearer of the ring is immune to the slippery effects of the ice and cannot fall prone, but may still use the ice as a means of traversal, reducing the cost of movement across the ice by half when sliding across it in this manner. This effect carries over to other slippery icy surfaces not generated by the ring as well.<br><br>
If the player wishes to freeze a creature, they must expend 5 charges from the ring in order to freeze a single medium or small size creature in ice. If they wish to freeze a creature of tiny size or below, they must expend 3 charges. If they wish to freeze a large creature, they must expend 10 charges from the ring. Additionally, if the player wishes to freeze a single limb of the target rather then their whole body, they may expend half of the required charges (rounded up) from their size class to freeze the desired limb.<br><br>
When a creature is frozen solid, they are incapacitated for 24 hours. When a creatures limb is frozen solid, they will either have their movement speed cut in half, or their attack bonus removed until they break the ice on their affected limb. In order to break the ice, they must make a strength saving throw, the difficulty of which is determined by the casters spell save dc, or if the wearer is not a caster, intelligence is used by default.
